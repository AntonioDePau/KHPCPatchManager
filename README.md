# KHPCPatchManager

## How to use:
1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/AntonioDePau/KHPCPatchManager/releases) or compile the binary yourself
2. Make sure you have a "resources" folder (in the same directory as the tool) with all the .txt containing the files' names (you can get one along with a release)
3. Drag a .kh2pcpatch file onto the tool and follow the instructions
